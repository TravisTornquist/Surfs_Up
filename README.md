# Surfs_Up
## Overview

To determine if the island of Oahu is suitable for a surf and ice-cream shop, we will perform an analysis of average temperatures in July and December. This will show if the temperature supports demand across both summer and winter months.

## Results

- The average temperature in the month of June is about 75 degrees. The average temperature in the month of December is about 71. Although there is a decrease in temperature in the winter months the difference is only about 4 degrees on average, so even in December the weather can support demand for a surf and ice-cream shop.
- The standard deviation of temperature in June and December is about 3.2 and 3.7 respectively. with such a small standard deviation the weather is reliably warm enough to support demand in June. December would still have many days over 70 degrees, but since the lower quartile is only 69 degrees there would be some days in December that are cold enough to drive away business.
- The maximum temperature in June and December is 85 and 83 degrees respectively. With a maximum temperature this high there will be days with high demand for surfing and ice-cream during both summer months and winter months.

## Summary

The temperature in both June and December will generally be over 70 degrees, although December will be more likely to have temperatures drop into the 60's. It appears that the temperature in Oahu will support demand for a surf and ice cream shop, but two more queries should be run. First, a query should be run to see how frequently the island sees rainfall. If there are many days of rain it could push down demand for the business. Second, a query should be run to see how many days Oahu has a clear sky compared to the number of overcast days. The business will do much better if sunny days are more common. This information could also identify potential slow seasons in the event Oahu has a rainy season.

Overall, it appears as though Oahu would be a good location for this business, but there is more analysis to be done before it would be wise to make a financial commitment.
